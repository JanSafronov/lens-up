# LensUp

Have you ever been on wedding or birthday party? If yes, you probably saw photo booth there. You get in, take a photo and paste it in the guest book. Simple and fun. What if we wanted to move this fun to the digital world? Here **LensUp** comes to help. This web application is a virtual gallery, where party guests can add their photos from event and write down wishes as well.



# 100 days roadmap

**Conclusion: **The main goal of 100 days plan is to deliver core functionality related to adding photos and wishes. I also want to do that without any extra cost for Azure services. So whole app should works on local environment with azure simulators like Azurite. This fact forces certain application architecture decisions, because not all Azure services can be simulated locally. Additionally MVP version doesn't focus on authentication, authorization and security.
